## Overview
This repository contains the R scripts used in the scientific paper: **"Networks of interactions between Marine Protected Areas and their effects on the conservation of the South American sea lion and the Southern right whale in the Western South Atlantic Ocean."**

The scripts are provided to ensure the reproducibility of our results and to serve as a resource for researchers studying marine conservation networks.

## Contents
This repository is organized into two main R scripts:

* **`Network_MPA_Script.R`**: This script generates the network graphs presented in the paper. It visualizes the connectivity and interactions between the different Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and their role in species conservation.
* **`Mapa_visualization.R`**: This script produces the geographical visualizations of the networks on a map. It shows the spatial relationships and distribution of the conservation efforts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run these scripts, you will need to have R installed. 

# Usage
To run a script, simply open it in RStudio or any R environment and execute the code. Make sure your working directory is set to the folder containing the script and the data files.

If you use these scripts or the methodology from the paper, please cite the original publication:
